# CircuitPython_projects

* The snow globe project [source](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-snow-globe/overview) code.py was
edited to improve the song tones and to randomize song selection. These changes were made for a
Cleveland PyLadies holiday craft & code event, held 12/16/18 at Forest City Brewery.
